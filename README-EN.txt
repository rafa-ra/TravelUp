[EN-US] Hello there !

"Travel Up" is a personal project with the intention of sharing my knowledge in front-end development.
The idea came from a personal passion: traveling. The value proposition would be to help the user to discover and 
define the best destinations and travel options for themselves or for a client. However, the main focus in developing
this application was to implement different technologies and tools commonly used in web development.

In this application, you will find:

React:

-JSX
-Virtual DOM
-useState
-useEffect
-useContext
-Components
-"Development seeking separation of concerns"
-Props
-Routing and navigation
-External APIs requests
-Conditional Rendering
-Javascript ES6

CSS:

-Grid
-Flexbox
-Transitions
-SaSS variables
-General styling with no external libs

Other:
-Semantic HTML 
-Vite development environment
-Github versioning
